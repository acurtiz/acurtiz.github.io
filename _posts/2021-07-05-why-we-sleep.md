# Part 1: This Thing Called Sleep

There are two factors which determine when we sleep and when we wake.

The first is the Circadian rhythm. Humans have an internal clock which keeps a consistent cycle. This clock is about 24 hours and 15 minutes long on average, which is notably longer than the 24 hour day. The internal rhythm synchronizes with external signals such as the sun to get a precise 24 hour cycle. The Circadian rhythm is controlled by the suprachiasmatic nucleus in the brain, and it sends signals out to the rest of the body to control various physiological functions. Temperature control is an example - our body gets cooler at night. Another is sleep, which is signaled outward from the brain via melatonin. Notably, this cycle will happen regardless of whether we sleep or not; in other words, if we delay sleep, our Circadian rhythm still proceeds. This partially explains why we feel an increase in alertness in the morning when we pull an all nighter.

The second factor is sleep pressure in the form of adenosine buildup. Adenosine accumulates in our brain when we are awake, and is cleared out of our brain when we are asleep. The more adenosine that is built up in our brain, the sleepier we feel. Caffeine functions by blocking adenosine receptors - thus, when caffeine wears off, we often feel a crash due to adenosine binding to receptors en masse since it has been building up despite the caffeine.

Caffeine is worth important mention due to its ubiquity. The half life is roughly five to seven hours, which means if we have a cup at noon, then half a cup's worth of caffeine is still circulating in our brain by 5:00 PM - and that is not a trivial amount.

These two factors - Circadian rhythm and adenosine buildup - are entirely independent. A delay in sleep causes more adenosine buildup, but your Circadian rhythm marches onward regardless. Optimal sleep requires the two to be in sync.

How do you know if you're getting enough sleep? A good rule of thumb is that you are not if you are feeling tired by 11 AM. Another rule of thumb is that if you are using an alarm clock and would naturally sleep beyond it, you are not getting enough sleep.

What subjective experience tells ourselves that we are asleep? First, the loss of external awareness. The thalamus in our brain blocks external perception when we are asleep. Second, the feeling of time distortion is a feature that helps us know we were asleep. While we are asleep, our *conscious* sense of time is lost but non-consciously, we are still tracking it accurately.

Science and technology has enabled us to get objective measurements of sleep, e.g. with electrodes on the head. This had led to defining sleep as two phases with distinct characteristics - rapid eye movement (REM) sleep, and non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. Furthermore, NREM sleep is divided into four phases (phase 1, phase 2, and so on), with phase 3 and phase 4 of NREM sleep being classified as deep sleep. These total five phases of sleep have different characteristics and functions. In multiple ways, they are not uniform. Throughout life, we get different amounts of different types. REM sleep is heavy during childhood, and NREM becomes more important in teenagers and young adults. In the human adult, NREM sleep dominates the early part of the night and REM sleep dominates the tail end of the sleep session. This has important consequence - if we go to sleep at 4 AM and wake up at 10AM, you're cleaving off the early part of the night thus you are missing out on important NREM sleep. Conversely, if you sleep at 10PM and wake up at 4AM, you're disproportionately losing out on REM sleep.

As for function, NREM is seemingly important for removing unnecessary neural connections, and REM sleep is important for creating new ones and strengthening existing connections. NREM also is critical for memory - during NREM, short term memory gets consolidated into long term storage. REM is critical for creativity and emotional health.

What is the natural sleep pattern of humans? There is significant evidence that the natural pattern is to have a long bout of sleep at night (7-8 hours), and to have a shorter period of sleep (30 to 60 minute) in the early afternoon. This has been observed in the few modern hunter gatherer tribes. When the few modern cultures such as Spain and Greece started moving away from this biphasic pattern by removing the afternoon siesta, a plethora of negative health outcomes were observed in studies. Also, the period of night sleep has been delayed so it starts later and ends later (or, for many, it ends earlier) with the advent of electricity in particular.

The young brain is particular vulnerable to disruption. Many developmental disorders like autism have been at least linked to abnormal sleep patterns. Proper sleep *especially* at early life is obligatory.
