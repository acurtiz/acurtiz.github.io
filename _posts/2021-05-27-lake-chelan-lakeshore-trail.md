   description: "I was fortunate enough to go on a 3-day, 2-night backpacking trip around Lake Chelan in the summer of 2021 with a friend. It was a really breathtaking trip. We drove to Chelan, WA in the morning and took the ferry to Prince Creek. We then hiked about 11 miles along the coast and camped the night at Moore Point. The next day we walked another 7 miles until we reached Stehekin, WA. Stehekin is quite an interesting town; it's inaccessible by road, so you must hike, boat, or fly in. We went swimming and spent a good amount of time at the town bakery on the final morning, which was an awesome way to conclude the trip."
