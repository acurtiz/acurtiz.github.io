Doodle Drive was my senior design project at Purdue University, completed in Spring of 2013.<br>
At a high level, it is a 4-wheeled robot which interacts with an Android tablet running a program which interacts with Google maps. A path is drawn over the map and the robot follows that path.<br><br>
I was a member of a group of four other talented engineering students!<br>
The project spanned the entire semester and involved conceptualizing the idea, choosing the parts to use, designing the schematic, creating the PCB layout, mounting the components on said PCB, writing the microcontroller code, and writing the tablet code.<br>
