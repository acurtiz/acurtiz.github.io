I made this game back in 2015 in Javascript with the usage of jQuery; it's inspired by a Warcraft 3 custom game called Maze of Sliding Bunnies, although it's a simplistic version and I really haven't added the necessary polish to call it complete. I plan to remake it!

<b>How to play:</b> the small black box is your character. Clicking on the canvas will move the little square to your click location. On green space, the character will continue on it's trajectory (i.e. sliding), so be careful. Avoid red walls and blue enemies. The yellow space is a safe zone (you cannot die here).
