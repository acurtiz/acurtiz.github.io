   description: "The second group of cats I ever took care of was a pair of older cats - Barbara and Bill. They stayed with me back in autumn 2020. I didn't get nearly as many pictures as the four kittens that I had previously taken care of, and they stayed with me for a much shorter period before getting adopted (this is good!). Barbara was quite scared at first, while Bill was actually the complete opposite - he took very little time to warmup to me and he reaaaaaaally loved to get his head scratched. Still, by the end of their time at my place, Barbara was much more outgoing and they were a joy to have around."
