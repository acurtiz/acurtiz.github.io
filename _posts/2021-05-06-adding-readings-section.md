Hello hello!

One of my key goals of 2021 was to read more books. My relationship to books, over the span of my life, has been a bit interesting. I of course read everything that was required of me in school, and I even read some books of my own choosing when I was much younger. Occasionally, I would become absolutely enthralled in these; that was certainly the case for the *Harry Potter* series. I got away from that for a while, and rediscovered it to a small degree while I lived in California in the early-mid 2010s, but I subsequently lost that interest again. I rediscovered it *once more* in 2020, and I decided my appetite for both knowledge in the form of non-fiction books and compelling fictional stories was at an all-time high. Thus, I made it one of my most important goals for 2021. It's not even a very specific goal - it's simply to read more books.

Sometimes, I get the urge to take a book a bit deeper than others. I get the urge to explore it and really reflect on it, and I often have the urge to even write down these reflections. I hope to explore this process completely and see what works for me. The ultimate point is both to let my curiosity drive me unimpeded, and to really try to understand the places where my curiosity takes me.

For now - when I find the urge to write something about a book - whether that's a summary of it, reflections of those contents, or something completely different - I'll add it to this website.

Cheers!!!
