   description: "I've traveled to Cleveland, Ohio a few times in the past three years since my mom, brother, sister-in-law, and nephew live (now past-tense!) there but it was only this most recent and perhaps final trip out there that I finally got out to the nearby national park in Cuyahoga Valley. The word I can best use to describe it is lush. The beaver marsh was probably my favorite part - I learned that this area was restored not long ago. The Brandywine Falls are apparently quite popular as well, and understandbly so. Thanks to the friendly ranger at the entrance for mapping out a good route for me!"
